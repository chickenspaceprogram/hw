# hw

`hw` is a little bash script that automates creating git repos with .tex files and .gitignores.

It's available here both since this was an easy way to transfer it over to my Linux machine and because someone else might get use out of it.

To use it, place it on your $PATH (I put it in /usr/local/bin/hw), and type `hw --help` or `hw -h` to see the help message. If you want to see the version, type `hw --version` or `hw -v`.
